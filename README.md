Each folder contains:
- Problem solution file  
- Clean, readable implementation  
- Optimal or near-optimal approach

## 🧠 Approach & Standards

For every problem, I follow these rules:

- **Brute force → optimized approach**
- Explicit handling of **edge cases**
- Preference for **O(n)** or **O(log n)** solutions
- Code written as if explaining to an interviewer

Languages used:
- **C**
- **C++**

## 🧪 What You’ll Find in Each Solution

- Problem-solving logic (not shortcuts)
- Meaningful variable names
- Comments where reasoning matters
- Interview-safe implementations

I avoid:
- Over-engineered solutions
- Unreadable one-liners
- STL abuse without justification
